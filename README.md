Welcome to the Quantum Computing Projects repository! This repository contains implementations of fundamental quantum protocols, as well as other quantum computing algorithms and experiments.

1.Quantum Teleportation Protocol:

The quantum teleportation protocol allows the transfer of quantum states between two distant qubits without physically moving the qubits. It leverages the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, measurement, and classical communication. In this section, you'll find:

An explanation of the teleportation process.

Code implementation using Qiskit.

2.Superdense Coding:

Superdense coding is a quantum communication protocol that enables the transmission of two classical bits of information by sending only one qubit. This section includes:

A detailed explanation of the protocol.

Code implementation of superdense coding in IBM quantum simulator.
